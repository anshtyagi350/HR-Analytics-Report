Excited to share my latest project on HR Analytics using Power BI!

In this project, I leveraged data cleaning, modeling, and advanced visualization techniques to provide insights on various factors of attrition of employee. Multiple sheets and dashboards allow for a comprehensive look at key trends and actionable insights, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions for enhancing the experience of employee and keep in mind all the factor of attrition. 

✅ Data Cleaning: Ensured accuracy and consistency by removing redundancies and irrelevant data. 
✅ Data Modeling: Structured the data to highlight critical relationships and trends. 
✅ Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards for deeper analysis and clear understanding.

Working on this project has deepened my understanding of how data can drive real-world change. If you're interested in discussing freelance opportunities in data analytics or BI solutions, feel free to reach out!
